# Hayat Outahar

I work on digital sovereignty, technological governance, and ethical innovation.  
My focus is the strategic use of emerging technologies to strengthen autonomy, accountability, and public trust.

## Focus areas
- Digital sovereignty and geopolitical dependencies in the digital space
- Governance models for complex technological systems (public, private, hybrid)
- Responsible AI, accountability, and institutional resilience
- Blockchain and distributed infrastructures for transparency and coordination
- Civic and public-interest innovation, with a pragmatic approach

## Current projects
- Writing and publishing strategic analyses on digital sovereignty and global power dynamics
- Developing educational content and workshops on digital innovation for decision-makers
- Building frameworks to evaluate technology choices through sovereignty, risk, and ethics lenses

## Method
I combine:
- grounded analysis (facts, institutions, incentives, governance constraints)
- systems thinking (interdependencies, second-order effects, long-term trajectories)
- actionable outputs (frameworks, decision guides, training material)

## Relationship with technology
I treat technology as a tool of power.  
My priority is to align innovation with empowerment, sovereignty, and ethical progress.
